# Crime, Housing Prices, and Urban Inequality: A Big Data Study in Adelaide, SA

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between crime rates and housing prices through exploratory data analysis and clustering techniques. The analysis aims to identify patterns and correlations between criminal activity and real estate values in Adealaide suburbs on spatial analysis.

## Dataset Description

The project uses 3 main datasets:

- **SA Crime Statistics**: Contains cleaned crime statistics including crime types, frequencies, and geographic information
- **SA House Rate & Sales Data**: Contains cleaned housing market data including prices, property characteristics, and location details

Both datasets have been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

- **Adelaide Suburb Shape Files**: Contains Adelaide Suburb geographical boundaries shape file, extract the zip file before use.
